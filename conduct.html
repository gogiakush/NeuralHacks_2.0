                    NeuralHacks is dedicated to providing a harassment-free space for everyone, regardless of gender, age, sexual
                    orientation, ability, physical
                    appearance, race, or religion. <br /><br />
                    We do not tolerate harassment in any form from attendees. Sexual language and inappropriate imagery is not
                    appropriate for submitted
                    projects or at any time or place during the event, including talks, workshops, receptions, and online media.
                    Attendees violating these
                    rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the event without travel reimbursement at the discretion of the event
                    organizers. Any events that
                    violate the NeuralHacks Code of Conduct should be reported as specified in the procedures at the end of the
                    document. <br /><br />
                    All attendees are expected to comply with the NeuralHacks Code of Conduct at all times during the hackathon and
                    all related hackathon events.

                    Harassment includes, but is not limited to: offensive verbal or written comments related to gender, age,
                    sexual orientation, ability,
                    physical appearance, race, religion; sexual or graphic images in public spaces; deliberate intimidation;
                    stalking or following; harassing
                    photography or video recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact;
                    and unwelcome sexual
                    attention.
                    <br /><br />
                    Attendees exhibiting any of these harassing behaviors will be asked to stop immediately. Attendees asked to
                    stop any harassing behavior
                    are expected to comply immediately. All attendees, including sponsors, speakers, volunteers, and organizers
                    are also expected to follow
                    the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other
                    graphic materials. Booth staff
                    (including volunteers) should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized
                    environment.
                    <br /><br />
                    In addition, all hacks or projects submitted by teams that violate this code may be disqualified or denied the
                    right to demo at the
                    discretion of the event organizers.
                    <br /><br />
                    Photography is encouraged, but attendees must be given a reasonable chance to opt out from being photographed.
                    If they object to being
                    photographed, please comply with their request. It is inappropriate to take photographs in contexts where
                    people have a reasonable
                    expectation of privacy, for example in bathrooms or when attendees are sleeping.
                    <br /><br />
                    If an attendee engages in harassing behavior, the event organisers may take any action they deem appropriate,
                    including warning the
                    perpetrator or expelling them from the event with no reimbursement.
                    <br /><br />
                    If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please
                    follow the reporting procedures
                    at the bottom of this document and report the incident immediately. NeuralHacks staff will be clearly identified
                    and the Co-Directors can be
                    reached at all times via the contact information listed below.
                    <br /><br />
                    If a participant engages in harassing behavior, NeuralHacks staff may take any action it deems appropriate,
                    including warning the offender or
                    expulsion from the event with no eligibility for reimbursement or refund of any type. If you are being
                    harassed, notice that someone else
                    is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact NeuralHacks staff using the reporting procedures
                    defined below.
                    <br /><br />
                    NeuralHacks staff will help attendees contact venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or
                    otherwise assist those
                    experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event, if necessary. We value your participation
                    and expect all attendees to
                    follow these rules at hackathon and workshop venues, online interactions in relation to the event, on
                    NeuralHacks-supplied transportation,
                    and all other related hackathon events.
